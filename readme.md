# Wasted Time Recorder #
A single page app that keeps recording time so long as you hold the button. Unlike normal timers, you cannot accidentally leave this timer running. The cumulative time spent waiting is shown and recorded in local storage.

## Why ##
If you're wasting too much time waiting, record it with this app and report it to whomever you can so that you can get better equipment and be more productive.
